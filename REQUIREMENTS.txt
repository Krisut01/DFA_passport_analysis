The Modular Redesign Sprint
Project Goal

Select a public-facing service with accessibility/usability issues. Conduct a rapid analytic evaluation and propose a high-fidelity redesign of one core screen that strictly adheres to WCAG 2.x standards, built entirely from a Modular Design Framework (MDF).

 

Part 1: Diagnostic Evaluation & Analysis (40 Points)

This section remains analytical, focusing on the justification and findings.

System Context & Justification (15 Points) - Identify the system, its target user group, and main purpose. Explain the purpose, scope, context, and timing of your evaluation. Justify using a User-Free (Analytic) Setting for this time constraint.
Settings & Methods (P-BA 2) (15 Points)- Compare and contrast two different evaluation settings (e.g., Controlled vs. Natural setting). Justify the selection of your specific analytic evaluation method and briefly explain how it's combined with WCAG auditing.
Accessibility & Usability Findings (10 Points) - Document the Top 4 Critical Problems found. At least two problems must be Accessibility Issues, citing the specific WCAG 2.x Success Criterion violated (e.g., 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)).
Part 2: High-Fidelity Modular Strategy & Redesign (60 Points)
This section requires polished execution and robust accessibility rationale.

Basic Unit & High-Fidelity Visual System (15 Points) - Analyze the system to identify its core object or "basic unit." Define your High-Fidelity, WCAG-compliant Core Visual System, including:
Color Palette: Ensure colors meet WCAG 2.x AA contrast ratios (cite contrast for text/background).
Typography: Define accessible font sizes, weights, and clear hierarchy.
Style Definition: Define corner radii, shadow styles, and visual treatments required for Hi-Fi.
MDF Principles & Impact (15 Points) - Explain the core principles of MDF. Analyze its direct impact on reusability and future iterative development, specifically detailing how modularity ensures consistent, scalable accessibility.
High-Fidelity Mockup & WCAG Rationale (P-BA 3) (10 Points) - Create ONE high-fidelity screen mockup that solves the critical problems from Part 1. This must demonstrate:
Polished visual design adhering to your defined system.
Organized clustering of 3-5 core modular components.
A concise WCAG 2.x Rationale for each component, explaining how your design ensures accessibility (e.g., proper hover/focus states, semantic structure).
Specialized Component Adaptation & Quality (P-BA 4) (10 Points) - Adapt one of your core components (e.g., a button, a card) to meet the constraints of a specialized interface (e.g., smart watch, voice UI). Show the adapted component and briefly explain the necessary accessibility trade-offs. Overall clarity, professionalism, and visual coherence of the submission.
